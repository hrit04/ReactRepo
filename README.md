Parcel is ease to use, newer , need little configuration, for small projet parcel is recommended.

own words.
● - What is `.gitignore`? What should we add and not add into it?
-> it helps to ignore the folders/file which we should not want to push into our git repository
● - What is the difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
-> 
the package.json file focuses on project metadata and specifying the desired versions of dependencies, while the package-lock.json file ensures deterministic installations by locking the exact versions of dependencies and their dependencies

● - Why should I not modify `package-lock.json`?
  -it contains the exact version of the dependencies.

● - What is `node_modules` ? Is it a good idea to push that on git?
-> 
● - What is the `dist` folder?
